This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: creating multiple mutable references to the same variable within the same scope.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which will result in a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version, showcasing how to avoid this error by using techniques such as cloning, reordering, or using interior mutability.
